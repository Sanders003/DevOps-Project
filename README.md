# Flask Auth App with AWS Infrastructure

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow for deploying a Flask authentication application on AWS infrastructure using Terraform and GitLab CI/CD.

## Project Overview

The solution includes:

- A Flask authentication application container
- AWS infrastructure provisioning (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Private S3 bucket for sensitive data
- IAM roles for secure S3 access
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with testing and deployment

## Infrastructure Components

### AWS Resources Provisioned:

- **VPC** with public and private subnets
- **Internet Gateway** and **NAT Gateway** for network traffic
- **EC2 Instance** running Docker with the Flask app
- **Private S3 Bucket** for sensitive data storage
- **IAM Role** for secure S3 access from EC2
- **Security Groups** controlling access to the Flask app

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitLab CI/CD pipeline includes the following stages:

### Pipeline Stages:

1. **Lint**: Code quality checks using flake8
2. **Test**: Unit tests execution with pytest
3. **Build**: Docker image build and push to Docker Hub
4. **Deploy (Staging)**: Terraform infrastructure provisioning
5. **Test (Staging)**: Smoke tests against deployed infrastructure
6. **Cleanup (Staging)**: Manual cleanup of staging resources

### ðŸ”‘ CI/CD Variables

This project uses GitLab **CI/CD Variables** to securely store and manage credentials required for deployment and containerization.

| Variable                | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | AWS access key ID used for authentication when deploying resources. |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret access key for authentication with AWS services.         |
| `DOCKERHUB_NAME`        | Docker Hub username used to authenticate with Docker Hub.           |
| `DOCKERHUB_KEY`         | Docker Hub access token or password used for pushing images.        |

#### How to Set Them Up

- **AWS Keys** â†’ Create from AWS IAM â†’ Security Credentials â†’ Access Keys
- **DockerHub Token** â†’ DockerHub â†’ Account Settings â†’ Security â†’ Access Tokens
- **Add to GitLab** â†’ `Project Settings â†’ CI/CD â†’ Variables â†’ Add Variable`

> Ensure variables are marked **Protected** and **Masked** in GitLab.

### Successful Pipeline Run:

[Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/Sanders003/DevOps-Project/-/pipelines/1984987113)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform v1.0+
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanders003/DevOps-Project.git
   cd DevOps-Project
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform validate
   ```

### Deployment

1. Review the Terraform plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. Apply the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

## Security Features

- Private S3 bucket with restricted access
- IAM role with least-privilege permissions
- Security group restricting access to necessary ports
- Sensitive credentials managed through environment variables

## Cleanup

To destroy all created resources:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
